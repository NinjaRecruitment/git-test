# Hello World

I am a tech recruiter who specializes in developers and cyber security professionals. 

Personally I really enjoy mapping out attack surfaces/ OSINT and active directory. Eventually, I plan of polishing off my coding skills as well. 

Hopefully, I add value to this community and over time I can be considered quite the developer myself! What other tech recuiters do you know that actually cares about the technical stuff?
